# **Blockchain with Proof of Work (PoW) in C++**

A simple C++ implementation of a blockchain with Proof of Work (PoW) to demonstrate key blockchain concepts like block creation, chaining, and consensus. 

---

## **Features**

- **Block Creation**: Each block contains data, timestamp, hash, and previous block reference.
- **Proof of Work (PoW)**: Implements mining by requiring a valid hash with leading zeros.
- **Blockchain Validation**: Ensures block integrity and immutability.

---

## **Prerequisites**

- C++ Compiler (GCC, Clang)
- CMake
- OpenSSL (for SHA-256 hashing)

Install dependencies on Ubuntu:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install build-essential cmake libssl-dev
```

---

## **Installation**

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/BlockchainPoW.git
   cd BlockchainPoW
   ```

2. Build the project:

   ```bash
   mkdir build
   cd build
   cmake ..
   make
   ```

---

## **Usage**

Run the program:

```bash
./BlockchainPoW
```

It will mine blocks and print the blockchain.
